07:35:46	 From  Gerardo Garcia : https://test.mapnwea.org
07:36:41	 From  Gerardo Garcia : Make Up HS F20
07:36:50	 From  Gerardo Garcia : 2790
07:44:52	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : resumed
07:44:57	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Thank you
07:56:40	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Something up?
07:58:12	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : She is no longer on the screen
07:58:14	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : But she’s back
07:58:24	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Gotcha
07:59:23	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Sorry, scholar's mom sent me a medical document and I got distracted. This is also the first time I've seen her. 
08:00:47	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : I see shoulder but this can't be good for her back
08:10:01	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : As a heads up, she's completed 3 questions since she began this morning.
08:10:28	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : I thought she started at 5
08:10:33	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : I must not remember correctly
08:10:37	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : I thought it was 10... maybe I'm mistaken
08:11:10	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : I sent her a message, either way lol
08:11:54	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Not being able to monitor their phone is my biggest concern here, I think this would explain why some of them have the patience to sit in front of this for hours without going bonkers.
08:12:02	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Agreed
08:13:47	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : I’m literary taking up her whole screen by calling her
08:13:51	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : And she’s not responding
08:14:35	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Yeah... They're not even trying to be subtle. TBH that's the part that gets me most.
08:14:54	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Yeah, it is certainly frustrating
08:15:51	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : The funniest one was a scholar held his phone over the camera itself, blocking their face, and did this for 3-5 minutes before realizing that we had been trying to get his attention, his test was paused, and everyone was watching him. He turned red and almost cried from embarrassment.
08:16:11	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : omg
08:16:39	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : 14 @ 8:16
08:18:38	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Lets keep track
08:21:40	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : 15 @ 8:21
08:21:54	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : She’s on 17 on my screen
08:22:03	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : How odd
08:22:13	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Even by refreshing I see 16
08:26:48	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : BTW where is everyone else..?
08:26:58	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : I had Brandon and Carly call
08:27:03	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Gotcha
08:27:14	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : No answer from Quincy, Judayah, Larell, and Ryan
08:27:31	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : I’m seriously concerned about how hard it is to reach them and get them online...
08:27:45	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Its a basic expectation
08:29:39	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Yeah... I was in an internship with RIDE and missed summer school, but all I remember is how much of a pain it was to get them to join zoom sessions. There was a lot of optimism among those who were involved with the credit recovery, but this all still feels like business as usual. I'm actually surprised attendance has been as high as it was to begin with.
08:30:18	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : In a normal school day you mean? Yes its been pretty good!
08:30:56	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Incidentally, the type of scholar who would need make up testing is the type that would be least likely to show up for it.
08:31:10	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Exactly, unfortunately
08:32:14	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : I think it means the stakes need to change in some way that inconveniences them to change their participation, besides calling and chasing after them.
08:32:47	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Agreed—a lot of it is underlying issues like tech or different responsibilities due to the pandemic
08:34:24	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Right, but the school has also provided hot spots + replaced Chromebooks with new ones... I'm hoping the new government acknowledges high-speed internet as a public good and subsidizes it.
08:34:42	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : True
08:39:22	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Pause  --> Resume, so she can just click the button on her return
08:39:32	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Smart!
08:39:37	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : 6 years now 
08:39:38	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : lol
08:39:49	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Lol you learn a few things
08:39:51	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : wait 5

08:58:27	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Unsure how to get her back on
08:58:40	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : You said a minute
08:58:45	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : I know
08:58:47	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : We can't do anything but wait...
08:58:51	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Unless we call her house
08:59:02	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : I texted her but let me try calling
08:59:33	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Voicemail right away
09:00:34	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : It's on do not disturb I imagine
09:01:09	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Mom seemed to be there...

09:09:04	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : The person you are trying to reach is not accepting calls at this time.
09:09:09	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Oh boy
09:09:20	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : do I sent a quick note to OPs
09:09:29	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : No its okay
09:09:31	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : ok
09:09:36	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : We can each take a break though
09:09:47	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : If you want to use the restroom or not be on zoom for 5
09:09:48	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Sounds good.
09:09:55	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : You can go first
09:10:06	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Thanks, I just need a moment to bribe my rodents
09:11:34	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : I'm down half a bag of celery but I'm all set 
09:17:57	 From  Gerardo Garcia : 	(774) 319-6429
09:27:35	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Err random question based on a text I received from a parent... If a parent calls to excuse an absence preemptively, how do we deal with the demerits from their absence teachers put on live school?
09:27:51	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : I would contact the dean team
09:27:57	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Will do..
09:41:59	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Big one is bullying the small one, so I keep having to move to the side to let the smaller one eat.
09:42:33	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Oh no!
09:49:41	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : I have the small one her own pen so she can eat in peace, but I need to take down the divider in about 2-5 minutes. Will just be a moment.
09:49:49	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : in*
09:49:56	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Okay!
09:52:00	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : brb
09:56:04	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : She's making progress but I'm worried about losing her for half an hour + also burning her out with math
09:56:10	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Same
09:56:31	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Just need to check something
10:00:47	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : She probably hates us right now, she is getting so much attention! lol
10:02:46	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Just wait until more feelings come up when there's math in front of her
10:05:01	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : She's going to need paper + a pencil for the next one, that might be a way of giving her a chance to stretch, and she can leave the camera on
10:05:16	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Good idea
10:12:43	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Is she on 36 on your screen?
10:13:03	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : 37
10:13:20	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Gotcha, I paused it since it wasn't 2 seconds
10:22:56	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Do you mind if I take a call from a teacher? She said it’ll only have a few
10:23:03	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : *take
10:23:04	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : go ahead

10:27:03	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : *noise
10:30:24	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : It's better in the spring when they're in heat, and you think there's something dying in your walls. With a tree right by the window.
10:30:43	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Ahhh!
10:31:06	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : In college they'd actually get into our dorms and trash the place looking for food, it was a bit unnerving.
10:31:14	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : during spring breaks and stuff
10:31:16	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Yikes!
10:37:12	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Last question!
10:39:50	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : It may update for you faster than for me as a heads up. 
10:40:20	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : I think I can see where she is but you see what she has completed
10:40:36	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Right
10:45:56	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : This is what she was assigned: 	Growth: Math 6+ MA 2017If it's the wrong one, please speak now or forever hold your peace because I'm paranoid

10:51:21	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Agreed
10:53:48	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : I"ll pause it momentarily
10:54:29	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : She’s not there
10:54:51	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : There's a bug that says she's rapid guessed with the 0th pause of 0 
10:54:59	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : Weird
10:55:03	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : because I paused it before she submitted anything lol
11:00:07	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : 10:59 question 2 for some time now
11:01:01	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : She seems like she is paying attention, lets see

11:13:39	 From  Kristen Lima  to  Gerardo Garcia(Privately) : She’s doing pretty well with pacing on this one
11:14:07	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : She is, if she's on 9 right now she's almost 1/4 of the way done
11:14:30	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : maybe by noon she'll be done or so

11:16:06	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : Am I returning this afternoon?
11:16:48	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : oh
11:16:53	 From  Gerardo Garcia  to  Kristen Lima(Privately) : I read Jamal not Janiel
